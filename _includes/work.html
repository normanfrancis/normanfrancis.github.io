						<p>The goal of this site act as a testbed for experimenting with different technologies and tools. Speed and security were two of the reasons I decided to use Jekyll to build this site but also because it was something I new to me.  I plan to iterate on this site as I become more familiar with what Jekyll has to offer.</p>
